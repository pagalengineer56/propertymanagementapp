# propertymanagementapp
Create a property management system(web based application) with the following requirements. 1. When agent(property manager) opens the the webpage, it shows list of properties added in the system along with the option at the top to add a new property and delete a property. No need to add login/authentication features. 2. While adding a new property, ask for name, description and size, and add it to the list. This is the first part of assignment, where data is maintained in the front end(memory), and all data is lost on refresh.  In the 2nd part we need to save data in the backend as well. To save data you can use Airtable which is a free service to create tables online. It gives APIs to save data, get list of data etc. You can explore their APIs. You can also use any other service/db etc.
